# rock-paper-scissors
This game will expand on the rock paper scissors game I built for one of the Codecademy JavaScript exercises. The player will make their selection, then the computer will be assigned rock/paper/scissors using a random number generator.

At a bare minimum, I will shift the gameplay out of dialogue boxes and into the page itself. I will then add images and animations to make the game more interactive.

As a stretch, I will consider adding scorekeeping functionality into the game as well.
